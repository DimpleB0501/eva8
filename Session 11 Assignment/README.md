### Data collection for Bert
Run the script [python3 review_bs.py](https://github.com/DimpleB0501/eva8/blob/main/Session%2011%20Assignment/review_bs.py) to save reviews of a film (add url of the film at line number 7) as a text file. <br/>
I collected reviews of film pathan and spider man which are stored in [moview_review.txt](https://github.com/DimpleB0501/eva8/blob/main/Session%2011%20Assignment/movie_review.txt) file. <br/>
