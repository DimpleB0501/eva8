# Code 1 - The skeleton
\textbf{Target}
- Setting up the skeleton 
- Adding batch normalization to the layers
\textbf{Results}
- Parameters - 11,844
- Best training accuracy - 99.91 \%
- Best test accuracy - 99.34 \%
\textbf{Analysis}
- Model is overfitting
- Dropout layers need to be introduced to reduce the gap between training and test dataset
