# Code 1 - The skeleton
### **Target** 
- Setting up the skeleton 
- Adding batch normalization to the layers <br/>
### **Results** 
- Parameters - 11,844
- Best training accuracy - 99.91 \%
- Best test accuracy - 99.34 \% <br/>
### **Analysis**
- Model is overfitting
- Dropout layers need to be introduced to reduce the gap between training and test dataset
