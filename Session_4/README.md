**Target** <br/>
- Setting up the skeleton 
- Adding batch normalization to the layers
**Results** <br/>
- Parameters - 11,844
- Best training accuracy - 99.91 \%
- Best test accuracy - 99.34 \%
**Analysis** <br/>
- Model is overfitting
- Dropout layers need to be introduced to reduce the gap between training and test dataset
